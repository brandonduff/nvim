### Trying to get nvim easy to set up

### Manual things that should probably be automated
- This repo needs to be cloned into ~/.config
- Neovim will have to be installed (`brew install neovim`)
- YCM will probably need its install script run
- Exuberant CTags will need to be installed
- might have to run `sudo pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall neovim`
    - Speaking of which, hopefully pip is installed on the machine.
- Not a good way to test some of this except with a fresh machine.
